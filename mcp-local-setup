##Setup MCP locall##
We will be using Claude and Python sdk for our development work.

Steps:
1. Setup Claude locally, you can download and install Claude from https://claude.ai/download based on the OS you are using
2. Python SDK - https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk
3. We will be requiring initial setup to run and install mcp locally.
4. 'UV' is the rust package manager for python, which is flexible and faster compare to others so we will be using uv. Refer https://github.com/tarunwalia/mcp/blob/main/install-uv-pkg-manager
